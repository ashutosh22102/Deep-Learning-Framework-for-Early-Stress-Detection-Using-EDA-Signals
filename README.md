# Deep-Learning-Framework-for-Early-Stress-Detection-Using-EDA-Signals
This repository contains the implementation of our ICPR 2024 study, A Deep Learning Approach for Early Stress Detection Using Electrodermal Activity through Wearable Devices. The project introduces a deep learning-based framework for detecting stress at an early stage using Electrodermal Activity (EDA) signals collected through wearable devices.
